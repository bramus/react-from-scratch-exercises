# React From Scratch Exercise: State and `useState`

## Before you begin

1. Create new React App using `create-react-app`
2. Replace the `src/` folder from your fresh app, and replace it with the `src` folder from this exercise
3. Start the dev server and verify the contents on screen. It should show you a form.
4. Familiarize yourself with the app structure

## Assignment

1. Adjust `<App />` so that the form's search value is stored in a state variable, triggered by its `onChange` event

    - ðŸ’¡ The first argument of an eventhandler is the `event` object. From it you can access the current element using `event.target`. See [https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) for more info

2. Log the contents of the state value when submitting the form (``)

## Goals

- Gain familiarity with State and the `useState` Hook
