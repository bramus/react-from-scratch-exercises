# React From Scratch Exercise: Props and Components

## Assignment

1. Rework the `<App />` component from exercise `01-animals` so that it uses an `<Animal />` component with the props `name`, `image` and `estimate`.
2. Further adjust `<App />` so that it uses an `<Animals />` component with the props `animals`. It renders all `<Animal />` components.
3. Move the loading of the `animals.json` to `index.js` and pass the `animals` down to the `<App />` component.

## Goals

- Gain familiarity with Components
- Gain familiarity with props
- Gain familiarity with spreading and destructuring
